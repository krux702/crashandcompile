##Drop the Nines

In mathematical addition, you can "drop the zero", but a numerological twist also allows you to "drop the nines" to check some simple equations for validity.

For example, take the following example:

     19
    +54
    ---
     73

To demonstrate the concept, we first drop the 9 from the above problem and
get:

      1
    +54
    ---
     73

We add 1+5+4 to get 10.
We add 7+3 to get 10 as well
So you see, you can drop the nines from the addends.

##INPUT
Each input line contains an equation.
Assume that the equation starts in column 1 and will not exceed column 40,
Each input line contains only digits and the + and = symbols. End of data
is indicated by '#' on a line by itself.

##The Output
Prove or disprove the equation using "drop the nines".

##Sample Input:
    19+54=73
    91+13=104
    91+13=106
    29+6+21+44+20=124
    49+42+6+5=105
    49+31+49=137
    79+19+33=131
    99+22+47+10+33=211
    115+75=190
    #

##Sample Output:
	TRUE
	TRUE
	FALSE
	FALSE
	FALSE
	FALSE
	FALSE
	FALSE
	FALSE
