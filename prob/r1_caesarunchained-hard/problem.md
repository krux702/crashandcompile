##Caesar Unchained (or not)

Breaking crypto is fun.
If you think your up to it, let's give it a "crack"?
Funny huh? I thought so.
I'll give you a ciphertext.
Decrypt it.

Here's the hard part, I'm not going to tell you anything else.

Well, maybe one more hint. J -> I.

##INPUT
Each file will contain 1 or more input lines containing a string of uppercase letters, spaces, and punctuation representing a ciphertext generated by the Chained Caesar Cipher algorithm.
Assume that the string starts in column 1 and will not exceed column 40.

DANGER: YOU MUST READ IN THE ENTIRE INPUT FILE BEFORE PROCESSING. 

You can ignore empty lines. 

You'll need to figure out the type of crypto from the sample input/output below.

##The Output
Print out the decrypted message

## Sample Input

	RIID DT G RQQT.
	SSSD XT O OLUO.

## Sample Output

	THIS IS A TEST.
	THIS IS A TEST.
